# Real-Time-Chat-Application
🚀 Excited to share my latest project: a real-time chat application using Node.js and Socket.IO! 🌐💬

🔹 Built a chat application where users can join chat rooms, send messages, and see real-time updates.
🔹 Used Node.js for the server-side logic and Socket.IO for real-time communication between clients and the server.
🔹 Implemented features like user authentication, message broadcasting, and notification sounds.
